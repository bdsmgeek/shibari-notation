# Shibari Notation🪢📝

A standardized way of note taking on how to tie shibari ties.

## Assumptions

1. The user uses a doubled up line with a bite and double trailing ends.
2. The bite is always the initial lead line / working side of the rope.

## Format

```<target><instructions><repeat number: optional>```

1. target - first line should always refer to the target
2. instructions - the directions how to tie the rope
3. repeat number - how many times the before mentioned action should be performed.

New lines should be used to indicate a new section of the tie usually with a new target
